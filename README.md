## **HDI and Regime Transitions in Africa**

*Tracking human development through political change*

This Python-based project calculates the original Human Development Index (HDI) for African countries and explores how regime transitions — especially shifts from authoritarian to democratic governance — affect HDI performance over time.

### Key Features

* Computes the original HDI based on:

  * GDP per capita (current US$)
  * Life expectancy at birth, total (years)
  * Mortality rate, under-5 (per 1,000 live births)
  * School enrollment, primary (% gross)
  * School enrollment, secondary (% gross)

### Data Sources

* World Bank
* Polity5 / V-Dem data on political regimes

### Why Africa?

African countries provide a rich and diverse context for studying how political structures influence human development. Many states have experienced dramatic transitions in the last decades, offering valuable insights into the role of governance in shaping well-being.

### Tech Stack

* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* Jupyter Notebook
* CSV-based datasets
